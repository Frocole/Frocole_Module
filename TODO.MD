----
* AddForm.validateForm() needs some sanity checks 
    (indicator label length)
    (empty elements)
    (problemetic characters)
    (correct issues as a trailing / before saving)
* Support multiple databases to separate clients?
* Make sure teacher selection scales well (be able to mark them as teacher (and default to false) ?)
* Integrate into the module (but how about multiple databases then) ?

----
* DONE Complete translation.
* DONE Implement validateForm() in AddForm.php
* DONE Define Access on forms (restict to admin).
