Validation
----

* AddForm.validateForm() needs some sanity checks 
    (indicator label length)
    (empty elements)
    (problemetic characters)
    (correct issues as a trailing / before saving)

----
Multiple Clients
----

* Support multiple databases to separate clients?
* How to cope with it in the services?

----
More Management UI
----

* Add UI for managing users (move people of of a group)?
* Make sure teacher selection scales well (be able to mark them as teacher (and default to false) ?)

----
Further integration.
----

* Integrate services into the module (but how about multiple databases then) ?
 
----
* DONE Complete translation.
* DONE Implement validateForm() in AddForm.php
